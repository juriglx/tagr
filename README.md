## tagr
A command-line tagging tool.

# Why tagr?
- As a command-line tool tagr should work together with other command-line tools like sed and grep.
- tagr stores all tags in the working directory in a plain-text file called ".tags". It's easy to store ".tags" file on any device and have the tags where the tagged files and directories are.
- tagr stores the tags as JSON, so anybody can easily read them (even humans).
